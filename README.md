## A. Emilio DiStefano

Hi, I'm Emilio - a results-driven software engineer dedicated to the development of effective, efficient, and low-cost robotics and embedded system solutions.

## Projects:

### Project 1: 
![host-and-port](images/MemoryBot-logo.png)
## [MemoryBot](https://github.com/AEmilioDiStefano/MemoryBot)

This system is an update from my previous memory-bot-python project.  The system will be written in C++ and the vector data structure is replaced with a binary search tree with an inOrder search algorithm.  These changes will dramaticaly improve the time complexicy (_O(n)_ to _O(log n)_) of the functions whhich enable the program to find user questions to output the associated answers.  Ask memory bot to remind you the rate of acceleration due to the gravitational pull of our planet, or to remind you the name of your cousin Fabiola's most recent child.  With MemoryBot you can rest assured that important information will not be forgotten!  

### Project 2: 
![host-and-port](images/PlantSitter-logo.png)
## [PlantSitter](https://github.com/AEmilioDiStefano/PlantSitter)

PlantSitter is an embedded system which is able to detect changes in air temperature and soil humidity to trigger the execution of processes meant to maintain an optimal growing climate in controlled agricultural environments.  Whether you're producing agricultural procudts or you just need a reliable system to take care of your house plants while you're on vacation, PlantSitter is your ideal solution for maintaining plant health through the triggering of climatization control processes based on sensor input.
