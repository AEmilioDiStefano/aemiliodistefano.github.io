This is the profesisonal portfolio of A. Emilio DiStefano

## The following projects show my skills in developing for embedded systems, in writing secure C++ code optimized for memory management, and in developing for Linux environments:

### Project 1: 
![host-and-port](images/MemoryBot-logo.png)
## [MemoryBot](https://github.com/AEmilioDiStefano/MemoryBot)

This system will use binary search tree functionality to search vast data stores of questions and answers.  Think of MemoryBot as a helpful friend with a perfect memory.  Ask memory bot to remind you the rate of acceleration due to the gravitational pull of our planet, or to remind you the name of your cousin Fabiola's most recent child.  With MemoryBot you can rest assured that important perosnal or profesisonal information will not be forgotten!  

### Project 2: 
![host-and-port](images/PlantSitter-logo.png)
## [PlantSitter](https://github.com/AEmilioDiStefano/PlantSitter)

PlantSitter is an embedded system which is able to detect changes in air temperature and soil humidity to trigger the execution of processes meant to maintain an optimal growing climate in controlled agricultural environments.  Whether you're producing agricultural procudts or you just need a reliable system to take care of your house plants while you're on vacation, PlantSitter is your ideal solution for maintaining plant health through the triggering of climatization control processes based on sensor input.
